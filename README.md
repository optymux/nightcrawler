# NightCrawler ‚Äì An AI Powered Silent Watcher Bot

**NightCrawler** is an asynchronous Python bot that periodically monitors a specified results webpage and notifies its operator (Ahmet Erol Bayrak) via Telegram when certain keywords are detected. Inspired by spy films, all messages are written in a cryptic, code-like style using OpenAI.

## üîç What It Does

- **Hourly Monitoring**  
  The bot checks a results webpage every hour (using headless Chrome via Selenium).

- **Keyword Detection**  
  It scans for lines that include both the year `"2025"` and any of the phrases:  
  `"e-y√∂kdil"` or `"foreign language exam"` (case-insensitive).  

- **Cryptic Messaging**  
  When triggered, it uses the OpenAI API to generate a brief, film-style agent message that hints at the detected change, and sends it via Telegram.

- **Daily Reports**  
  Every morning at 09:00, the bot sends a short daily report ‚Äì either confirming silence or summarizing the last detected event.
